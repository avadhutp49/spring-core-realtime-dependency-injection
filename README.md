# spring-core-realtime-dependency-injection
Program implements dependency injection in Spring Core, enabling loose coupling, modular code, and centralized dependency management. It simplifies configuration, promotes "programming to interfaces," and automates dependency resolution and injection.

The program I have created implements dependency injection in the Spring Core framework. Dependency injection is a design pattern commonly used in software development to manage the dependencies between different components of an application.

In the context of the Spring Core framework, dependency injection allows for the inversion of control, where the control of creating and managing objects is transferred from the application code to the framework. Instead of explicitly creating and managing dependencies within the code, the framework handles the instantiation and injection of required dependencies.

The program utilizes the features provided by the Spring Core framework to achieve dependency injection. It defines various components, such as services, repositories, or controllers, as beans, which are managed by the framework's container. These components declare their dependencies through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection, allowing the framework to provide the required dependencies when creating instances of these components.

By utilizing dependency injection, the program achieves loose coupling between components, making the code more modular, maintainable, and testable. It promotes the principle of "programming to interfaces" rather than concrete implementations, allowing for flexibility and easier switching of dependencies. It also simplifies the configuration of an application by reducing the need for manual wiring and providing a centralized mechanism for managing dependencies.

The program demonstrates the benefits of dependency injection by showing how components can be easily interconnected and how the framework resolves and injects the required dependencies automatically. It exemplifies the power of the Spring Core framework in simplifying the development process and promoting good software engineering practices.
